This repository contains a simple C program that exhibits an unexpected behavior when using pointers to modify variables. The bug.c file shows the original code with the error, while bugSolution.c provides the corrected version and explanation. The core issue involves the lack of clear understanding of pointer functionality and how it alters memory locations. This example serves as a useful learning tool for programmers to understand memory management in C.
